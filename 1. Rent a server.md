# 1. You need to rent a server throught one of the providers

According to the ethernodes.org the largest server provider is: 
- Amazon; 
- Hetzner; 
- Google; 
- OVH; 
- & others..

I really doesn't matter which one to choose. 
The only thing you should care is the server parametrs (8 vCPUs, 64gb memory, 1TB SSD, Fixed IP address, 1gb/s)
